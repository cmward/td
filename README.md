Create independent todo lists for individual directories. 

Less elegant, less functional, and all around stupider version of 
[Steve Losh's t] (http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/).

Create the following alias in your .bashrc:

`alias td="python path/to/td.py --dir '.'"`

The lists are stored as `.td.txt`.
